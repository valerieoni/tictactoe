## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

        - Easily navigate the pages
        - Understand how to play

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        As a Returning Visitor, I want to:

        -  Explore a different grid size

    -   #### Frequent Visitor Goals

        As a frequent Visitor, I want to:
        -  Play tic tac toe with a friend or against a bot
        -  Play the game in turns
        -  have my marker symbol drawn when I click inside an empty cell
        -  know when I have won, lost or drawn the game
        -  restart the game when one ends

-   ### Design

    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The main colors chosen are teal, pink and grey.

    -   #### Typography
        -   The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
